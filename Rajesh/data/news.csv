e34bb4a1-2dbc-3fba-a354-ea59b77ba2f5;AAPL;Tech Bulls Look to Upcoming Earnings to Remedy ‘FANG Fatigue’;"(Bloomberg) -- After lagging behind the broader market for months, the world’s largest technology stocks suddenly perked up this week ahead of earnings. All it took was a reminder from Netflix Inc. that there’s still plenty of opportunity for growth.The five biggest technology companies posted their best week in nearly three months in a rally sparked on Tuesday by Netflix, which added two million more subscribers than Wall Street was expecting. The megacap gains were led by Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc., whose 9.2% advance was more than it had gained in six months before this week.After big tech stocks led the market higher for most of 2020, investors recently shunned the group in favor of stocks like cyclicals and small caps that tend to outperform in an economic rebound. Now the megacaps suddenly look more desirable if they can deliver on revenue and profit targets, as many analysts are predicting. The technology exchange traded fund Invesco QQQ Trust is on pace for $1.4 billion in inflows this week, the most in two months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“FANG names are attractive, particularly given the level of appreciation in other parts of the market,” said JPMorgan Chase analyst Douglas Anmuth. “In the early days of 2021, our conversations with investors suggest real FANG fatigue.”Analysts expect the big five -- Facebook, Amazon.com Inc., Apple, Microsoft Corp. and Google parent Alphabet -- to beat other companies in the S&amp;P 500 on profit growth for a 12th straight quarter. Their combined earnings are projected to expand 11% during the quarter that ended in December, compared with a decline of a similar size for the rest of the market, analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show.While their profits are poised for another record, the stocks have been stuck in a prolonged trading range. Since peaking in early September, their total market value has failed to make a new high for 97 straight sessions, the longest drought in almost two years. Apple and Alphabet are the only ones whose shares have hit new highs, while Facebook is trading about 10% from its peak.Microsoft will be the first major tech company to report on Jan. 26, followed by Apple and Facebook the next day. The software giant is in good position to gain market share and expand profit margins in an improving operating environment, according to Morgan Stanley. The company is projected to report fiscal second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.64, an increase of 8% from the same period a year ago, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue is projected to rise 9% to $40.2 billion.The Redmond, Washington-based company “represents a rare combination of strong secular positioning and a reasonable valuation,” Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss wrote in a research note this week naming the stock as a top pick.With most of the megacap tech stocks trading for under 10 times projected sales, risk from overheated valuations is more concentrated in software names like Snowflake, which is priced at more than 80 times, according to Ted Mortonson, a technology strategist with Robert W. Baird & Co.Positive preliminary results from a wide range of companies like T-Mobile USA Inc. and F5 Networks Inc. set the stage for a strong showing for tech, Mortonson said. He added that there are broad macroeconomic tailwinds supporting a variety of industries, including cybersecurity, cloud computing, semiconductors and 5G.“I’ve been doing this for 30 years and I’ve never seen so many positive and inter-related macro trends,” he said in an interview.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.";Fri, 22 Jan 2021 21:06:57 +0000;AAPL_2021-01-22;0.998;0.0
5361babc-928f-323f-8ac6-7406f3f2c1ef;AAPL;Intel CEO’s New Crusade Pits Investors Against U.S. Interests;(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp.’s new Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger wants the company to regain its former glory as the world’s leading chip manufacturer and he says it’s a strategic priority for the U.S.That pits the industry veteran against investors and analysts who are hankering for quick results and think Intel’s bottom line takes precedence.“This is a national asset. This company needs to be healthy for the technology industry, for technology in America,” Gelsinger told analysts late Thursday after pledging to keep most of Intel’s semiconductor production in-house. “It’s an opportunity to help and to unquestionably put Intel and the United States in the technology leadership position.”The stock dropped 9% in New York Friday, its worst day since October, on concern a manufacturing turnaround will take years and cost billions of extra dollars. Some investors had advocated for Intel to outsource more production before Gelsinger revealed his hand.“Catching up is both a long shot and long journey,” Jefferies LLC analyst Mark Lipacis wrote in a note titled “U.S. Semi Manufacturing Crusade = No Quick Turnaround.”Intel will struggle to live up to Gelsinger’s assertion that the company can catch and pass Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the current leader in chip production. However, his rallying cry resonates more with other audiences and may bring Intel allies in the new administration of U.S. President Joe Biden.The chip industry is at the heart of a growing national rivalry between China and the U.S. China is the biggest consumer of semiconductors and the government there has vowed to spend more than $160 billion to create a domestic semiconductor sector. So far, though, it still relies heavily on U.S. chipmakers.That equation has become more complicated amid increasing scrutiny of the global technology supply chain. While many U.S. companies still design advanced chips, they have them made by TSMC in Taiwan.Intel is one of the few remaining chip companies that supply themselves with leading manufacturing. And it still makes many chips in the U.S., with factories in Oregon, Arizona and New Mexico. These components power computers that run or design government encrypted communication, nuclear power plants, military hardware and banking systems.If Intel outsourced production to TSMC -- as some on Wall Street want -- the U.S. would lose a major advanced manufacturing sector and hand more crucial know-how to Taiwan, a country China calls a rogue province that is only 100 miles off the coast of the mainland.Some U.S. lawmakers have begun listening to Intel and other U.S. chip industry players who have argued for years that incentives to keep manufacturing in the country just aren’t enough compared with what’s offered in China and other parts of the world.Last year, a bipartisan bill to provide $50 billion of incentives to build production in the U.S. was proposed. But to put that seemingly staggering amount of money into perspective, earlier this month TSMC said it’s planning to spend as much as $28 billion on new plants and equipment this year.Read more: Chip Industry Wants $50 Billion to Keep Manufacturing in U.S.“What we’ve heard from the U.S. government is, we need access to advanced microelectronics technology and manufacturing here in the U.S.,” Intel’s outgoing CEO Bob Swan told analysts late Thursday. “We need a safe and secure supply chain increasingly here in the U.S.”While improving its own manufacturing, Intel could develop a technology partnership with TSMC and other major operators of chip foundries. TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co. are either working on or considering new factories in the U.S.Read more: Samsung Mulls $10 Billion Texas Plant“This type of a partnership could also leverage new U.S. tax credits for onshore manufacturing for further value creation,” Timothy Arcuri, an analyst at UBS, wrote in a note to investors on Friday.Last year, Biden proposed a 10% “Made in America” tax credit covering projects such as increasing domestic production and retooling or expanding manufacturing facilities.Even U.S. government spending power won’t quickly fix Intel’s main problem: The sheer difficulty of making chips. The tiny squares of silicon are home to billions of tiny switches or transistors. Intel factories in Oregon, Arizona and New Mexico churn out millions of these semiconductors a month. But doing that reliably has become increasingly difficult and TSMC has forged ahead by gaining more experience as the biggest maker of smartphone chips.Semiconductors made using Intel’s latest production technology, called 7-nanometer, won’t arrive until 2023, executives said late Thursday. The TSMC equivalent has been used by Apple to mass produce chips for the iPhone for about a year already.“Even if Intel does successfully execute on 7-nanometer, they are still a node behind TSMC,” said Raymond James analyst Chris Caso. “And we don’t think Intel can deliver leadership products without leadership in transistors because it has never been done before. That keeps Intel behind the industry for four more years.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.;Fri, 22 Jan 2021 20:56:12 +0000;AAPL_2021-01-22;0.9891;0.25

6d7f2a98-fde0-3e6e-bc60-cdd762d8cf9b;MSFT;Microsoft Says It ‘Messed Up’ on Pricier Plan for Xbox Live Gold;(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. backtracked on a plan to raise the price for subscriptions to Xbox Live Gold, its paid online gaming platform, after outrage from users. The price bump would have doubled the cost of an annual pass and bring a six-month subscription to $60. Last year, Microsoft removed the option for a full-year subscription at that price from the online store. The cost for a monthly subscription will also stay the same.“We messed up today and you were right to let us know,” the company said in a statement. “Connecting and playing with friends is a vital part of gaming and we failed to meet the expectations of players who count on it every day. As a result, we have decided not to change Xbox Live Gold pricing.”The earlier move would have pushed the price of Xbox Live Gold closer to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, a more expensive subscription that also gives access to games and other perks. Game Pass has become central to Microsoft’s strategy to attract loyalty with the recent release of the Xbox Series X console. But gamers were outraged that Microsoft announced the plan to raise the cost of a subscription so drastically, especially during the pandemic, when people have been spending more time on screens than usual and unemployment has risen. Users expressed frustration online, often comparing the subscription cost to Sony Corp.’s PlayStation Plus, which is $60 a year.On Twitter, where the subject was one of the top trending topics on Friday, a gamer named Zay said “Xbox users gotta sell their Xbox just so they can get Xbox live gold.”One user said Microsoft is out of touch with its community and the economic reality.In justifying the earlier move, Microsoft said the price of Xbox Live Gold “has not changed for years and in some markets, it hasn’t changed for over 10 years.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.;Sat, 23 Jan 2021 07:42:22 +0000;MSFT_2021-01-23;0.4933;0.0

1d45a5e8-3b47-3eed-b456-d1e2ad70155e;MSFT;Samsung Considers $10 Billion Texas Chipmaking Plant, Sources Say;(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. is considering spending more than $10 billion building its most advanced logic chipmaking plant in the U.S., a major investment it hopes will win more American clients and help it catch up with industry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.The world’s largest memory chip and smartphone maker is in discussions to locate a facility in Austin, Texas, capable of fabricating chips as advanced as 3 nanometers in the future, people familiar with the matter said. Plans are preliminary and subject to change but for now the aim is to kick off construction this year, install major equipment from 2022, then begin operations as early as 2023, they said. While the investment amount could fluctuate, Samsung’s plans would mean upwards of $10 billion to bankroll the project, one of the people said.Samsung is taking advantage of a concerted U.S. government effort to counter China’s rising economic prowess and lure back home some of the advanced manufacturing that over the past decades has gravitated toward Asia. The hope is that such production bases in the U.S. will galvanize local businesses and support American industry and chip design. Intel Corp.’s troubles ramping up on technology and its potential reliance in the future on TSMC and Samsung for at least some of its chipmaking only underscored the extent to which Asian giants have forged ahead in recent years.The envisioned plant will be its first in the U.S. to use extreme ultraviolet lithography, the standard for next-generation silicon, the people said, asking not to be identified talking about internal deliberations. Asked about plans for a U.S. facility, Samsung said in an email no decision has yet been made.“If Samsung really wants to realize its goal to become the top chipmaker by 2030, it needs massive investment in the U.S. to catch up with TSMC,” said Greg Roh, senior vice president at HMC Securities. “TSMC is likely to keep making progress in process nodes to 3nm at its Arizona plant and Samsung may do the same. One challenging task is to secure EUV equipment now, when Hynix and Micron are also seeking to purchase the machines.”Read more: Intel Talks With TSMC, Samsung to Outsource Some Chip ProductionIf Samsung goes ahead, it would effectively go head-to-head on American soil with TSMC, which is on track to build its own $12 billion chip plant in Arizona by 2024. Samsung is trying to catch TSMC in the so-called foundry business of making chips for the world’s corporations -- a particularly pivotal capability given a deepening shortage of semiconductors in recent weeks.Under Samsung family scion Jay Y. Lee, the company has said it wants to be the biggest player in the $400 billion chip industry. It plans to invest $116 billion into its foundry and chip design businesses over the next decade, aiming to catch TSMC by offering chips made using 3-nanometer technology in 2022.It already dominates the market for memory chips and is trying to increase its presence in the more profitable market for logic devices, such as the processors that run smartphones and computers. It already counts Qualcomm Inc. and Nvidia Corp. as customers, companies that historically relied on TSMC exclusively. It has two EUV plants, one near its main chip site in Hwaseong, south of Seoul, and another coming online nearby at Pyeongtaek.To close a deal, Samsung may need time to negotiate potential incentives with U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration. The company has hired people in Washington D.C. to lobby on behalf of the deal and is ready to go ahead with the new administration in place, the people said. Tax benefits and subsidies will ease Samsung’s financial burden, but the company may go ahead even without major incentives, one of the people said.Samsung has been looking into overseas chipmaking for years. Intensifying trade tensions between the U.S. and China and now Covid-19 are stoking uncertainty over the reliability and economics of the global supply chain. Plants in the U.S. could help the Korean chipmaker strike better deals with key clients in the U.S., particularly in competition with TSMC.From Microsoft Corp. to Amazon.com Inc. and Google, the world’s largest cloud computing firms are increasingly designing their own silicon to power their vast data centers more efficiently. All need manufacturers like TSMC or Samsung to turn their blueprints into reality.Samsung’s U.S. branch purchased land in October next to its existing Austin fab, which is capable of running older processes. The Austin City Council held a meeting in December to discuss Samsung’s request to rezone that parcel of land for industrial development, according to meeting minutes.The Korean company’s existing Texas facility is too small to to meet increasing orders for outsourced chips coming from Qualcomm, Intel and Tesla, according to research by Citibank. Intel in particular is likely to funnel more orders toward Samsung to offset any reliance on TSMC for its foundry needs, the brokerage said in a report.Late Thursday, Intel’s incoming Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger told investors he was likely to keep most production of the company’s best processors in-house and that the delayed introduction of new manufacturing technology was showing signs of improving. Still, his comments disappointed some investors who have been lobbying for more outsourcing by the world’s largest chipmaker. Intel shares dropped as much as 9% in New York trading Friday, the most since October. Rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which relies on TSMC for production, gained as much as 4.8%.Read more: Samsung Intensifies Chip Wars With Bet It Can Catch TSMC by 2022Some analysts question Samsung’s ability to carve out a significant share of a market dominated by TSMC, which is spending a record $28 billion this year to ensure it remains at the forefront of technology and capacity. For its part, Samsung’s semiconductor division spent $26 billion on capital expenditure in 2020, but that’s been largely in support of its dominant memory business and not all of its expertise in making memory is directly relevant to creating advanced logic chips.Processors are more complex to manufacture than memory and their production yields are harder to control and scale up in the same way. Foundry customers also require bespoke solutions, imposing another barrier to rapid expansion and also making Samsung dependent on customers’ designs. But the Korean giant can draw confidence from its work with Nvidia, whose chief executive officer has sung Samsung’s praises in collaborating on the manufacturing for its latest graphics card silicon.(Updates with Intel plans in 14th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.;Fri, 22 Jan 2021 16:49:19 +0000;MSFT_2021-01-22;0.9987;0.0

6c7d8b15-b952-3c43-bd1b-8ceb57f1fa1f;MSFT;Unusual Options Activity Insight: Microsoft;"On Friday, shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved up to $229.61.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2021-02-19  * Strike Price: $240.00  * Volume: 32311  * Open Interest: 53698Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer).Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts that are ""out of the money"" are also indicative of unusual options activity. ""Out of the money"" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Benzinga's Top Ratings Upgrades, Downgrades For January 22, 2021  * 10 Information Technology Stocks With Unusual Options Alerts In Today's Session(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

c71f8229-1ea3-33eb-a91a-56f9538fd856;MSFT;IBM Shares Tumble After Another Quarterly Revenue Decline;"(Bloomberg) -- International Business Machines Corp. shares fell the most in 10 months after the company reported a greater sales decline in the fourth quarter than analysts had expected, signaling Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna’s turnaround plan may take more time.Sales fell 6.5% to $20.4 billion in the three months ended Dec. 31, the Armonk, New York-based company said Thursday in a statement. That was below the $20.75 billion analysts had forecast, on average, and marked the 10th consecutive quarter with no year-over-year increase in revenue.“This is a sequential change which seems to be notably below trend,” said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., on Thursday’s earnings call.The shares fell 11% Friday morning in New York to as low as $117.40. It was the biggest intraday decline since March 16. The stock declined about 5% over the past 12 months through the close of trading Thursday, lagging the 16% gain in the S&amp;P 500 during that time.Last October, Krishna announced he would spin off IBM’s managed infrastructure services unit into a separate publicly traded company. The division, which is currently part of IBM’s Global Technology Services division, handles day-to-day infrastructure service operations, like managing client data centers and traditional information-technology support for installing, repairing and operating equipment.While the unit accounts for about a quarter of IBM’s sales and staff, it has seen business shrink as customers embraced the shift to the cloud, and many clients delayed infrastructure upgrades during the pandemic. The spinoff is scheduled to be completed by end of 2021.Revenue declined across IBM’s business segments in the fourth quarter. Cloud and Cognitive Software, IBM’s biggest unit, saw revenue decrease 4.5% from a year earlier. That follows a 7% gain in that unit in the third quarter. Total cloud revenue increased 10% to $7.5 billion.That was the most revenue from cloud yet for IBM, but it was a slower pace of growth than the 19% gain in the previous quarter. In Global Technology Services, revenue fell 5.5% while sales from Global Business Services dropped 2.6%. Systems, which includes hardware and operating systems software, saw sales decline 18%.IBM attributed the quarter’s disappointment to weaker software sales caused by business uncertainty during the pandemic. The company saw a significantly lower demand for transaction processing software used by banks, airlines and retail.Krishna said the company’s actions to focus on cloud and artificial intelligence “will take hold,” and give him “confidence we can achieve revenue growth in 2021.” The company hasn’t given specific financial forecasts since it withdrew its annual projection for 2020 in April.“It’s more or less a reflection of the difficult spot they’re in,” in trying to restructure the business, said Daniel Elman, an analyst at Nucleus Research.IBM seeks to distinguish itself from its bigger rivals in cloud, such as Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp., by offering a hybrid model, which assists clients in storing and computing data across on-premises infrastructure, private cloud services and servers run by public providers. Krishna was the driving force behind IBM’s $34 billion purchase of open source software provider Red Hat in 2018, the first step toward transitioning IBM into what it sees as a $1 trillion hybrid-cloud market, and which now leads much of the company’s growth. Red Hat revenue increased 19% in the fourth quarter to $1.3 billion.IBM continues to make acquisitions to bolster its cloud credentials. The company has made seven acquisitions focused on cloud and AI since October, Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh said in the statement, including Taos Mountain LLC, a firm that helps companies shift software and data online, and Instana, which manages cloud applications.Fourth-quarter earnings excluding some costs were $2.07 a share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.79. Gross margin was 52.5%, 1.3 percentage points higher than analysts’ expected.(Updates with shares in fourth paragraph.
